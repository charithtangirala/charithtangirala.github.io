          <p>
            I have over eight years of industry experience in designing and developing web applications,
            RESTful services and implementing reusable software components. I have extensive background
            in the areas of enterprise collaboration, voice platforms. My latest project is in the healthcare
            industry, which is giving me hands-on experience with several healthcare standards such as HL7, ADT, etc.

          <h4>Infor</h4>
          <cite class="subtitle">Sr. Software engineer, 2014 - present</cite>
          <p>
            Currently playing an integral role in a small development team helping build a near-real time processing
            engine to analyze a variety of data sources to compute operational cost of a healthcare facility every
            fifteen minutes. The operational cost is computed across employee payroll and supply/procedure charges used
            for a patient visits. The data sources come from various other products, which are all channeled through Infor
            Cloverleaf and stored into a set of source tables. The data from the source tables is then transformed by
            business logic, which is then populates a series of star-schemas (multi-dimensional data model).
            The data from multi-dimensional schema is then uploaded to Infor BI (an OLAP server) to build front-end reports.

          <h4>Cisco</h4>
          <cite class="subtitle">Software engineer, 2006 - 2014</cite>
          <p>
            Primarily worked on Cisco Unified Call Manager and Hosted Collaboration Solution. Implemented several web
            applications (admin and end-user), RESTful web services that are currently being used by many partners and
            customers. I also designed and implemented a UI generation framework, which uses an XML (meta-data) to
            generate both server-side and client-side components.
          </p>
          <h4>Motive Inc.</h4>
          <cite class="subtitle">Associate developer, 2005 - 2006</cite>
          <p>
            Primarily worked on Home Device Manager (HDM) and TR-069 validator (Handshake). HDM is a tool that lets
            service providers manage CPEs using TR-069 protocol such as zero-touch provisioning, firmware updates,
            monitoring, etc. Handshake is a tool that was used to validate several CPE manufacturers against TR-069.

          <h4>HCS fulfillment application</h4>
          <cite></cite>
          <p>
            Designed and implemented various components of fulfillment application for HCS such as java services,
            RESTful services, client-side web application. This application interacts with various other Cisco’s
            Collaboration products deployed in Service Provider’s cloud.
          </p>
          <h4>UI Shell</h4>
          <cite></cite>
          <p>
            Designed and implemented a UI Shell framework in Javascript, which contains rich APIs that can be used to
            quickly create a web application based on single-page architecture. Multiple business units within Cisco now
            use the framework.
          </p>
          <h4>Code generation</h4>
          <cite></cite>
          <p>
            Architected and implemented a UI code generation framework that is capable of generating both client-side and
            server-side code. The generator uses XML files as input, which is unmarshalled using JAXB and then parsed to
            create HashMaps, which are then fed into Freemarker templates to generate source code.
          </p>
          <h4>User Data Services (UDS)</h4>
          <cite></cite>
          <p>
            Architected and implemented the initial version of a REST based web service for UCM to interact with end-user
            specific data. The service is fully auto-generated from a XML meta-data file. Cius was the first product to
            leverage UDS and this service is now widely used in majority of Cisco end-points including Jabber.
          </p>
          <h4>Javascript state machine</h4>
          <cite></cite>
          <p>
            Designed, architected, and implemented a javascript state machine that is intelligent enough to render a page
            based on its current state – new or edit. The state machine automatically maps form data to JSON and submits an
            AJAX request to the server as well as fetches JSON data from server-side and automatically maps them to form
            fields on the page.
          </p>
          <h4>UI functional testing framework</h4>
          <cite></cite>
          <p>
            Researched and implemented an automated functional testing framework for web applications using Selenium.
            Presented the prototype to many engineering teams across my Business Unit and this prototype has been the stepping
            stone for several UI functional test frameworks ever since within the Technology Group.

          <p>
            Actively contributing towards Mozilla foundation in the area of WebRTC by fixing defects related to Firefox’s
            implementation of WebRTC API (JSEP).
