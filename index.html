      <h2>Namaste!</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer by profession and I am constantly poking my head into multiple disciplines of computer science.
        I am currently employed at Cisco and work in the Collaboration Technology Group. Ouside of work, I love cooking (and eating),
        traveling, photography and playing video games (mostly MMOs). If you are interested in knowing more about my professional
        accomplishments, then take a look at my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.

              The recent outburst of social media web sites such as facebook, twitter and linkedin has introduced new challeges and
              business opportunities. The challenge is that end users such as you and me are constantly uploading massive amounts of
              media (audio, video and text) and the challenge is twofold, storage and computing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lets talk storage issues. Up until now relational databases have done a decent job in storing end user data. Typically,
              there is a cluster of database servers and each server in the cluster is replicated for redundancy and high availabitly.
              All the data is stored in a single database server. But once data starts to grow into massive numbers for a single user,
              it starts putting a hole in this model. This is because it is not possible to store all this data on a single database
              server. The solution is to distribute the data across multiple database server. This is where NoSQL databases come to
              your rescue!
            </p>
            <p>
              As data grows larger, processing the data and performing complex operations also becomes challening and time consuming.
              Distributed and/or parallel computing is a logical solution in this scenario. In particular the MapReduce programing model
              is used to process large sets of data using parallel, distributed algorithms on a cluster of computers. The most popular
              open-source implementation of MapReduce programming model is Apache Hadoop. If you haven't already jumped on the Big Data
              bandwagon, it is time you jump on it as this field is growing fast.

            <p>
              If you aren't already familiar with the ongoing efforts in the area of WebRTC, then let me catch you up quickly! Google
              started to toy around with the idea that any real-time communication (audio, video and data) over web should be browser independent
              and plugin-free. In other words, media streaming capabilities must be native to all browsers and must be easily available
              to developers in form of javascript APIs and HTML syntax. You might be thinking, "WoW! Thats a huge effort to get all browser
              vendors to implement this." You are right, it is a massive effort and thats where IETF steps in. IETF formed a group called
              RTCWeb (Real Time Communications over Web) in order to impose standards and specifications and in general to govern the
              implementation by various browser vendors. RTCWeb and WebRTC are exactly same except that the term RTCWeb is used when someone
              is talking about the IETF specifications and WebRTC is often used when someone talks about the W3C implementation of IETF specs.

              Does it sound exciting yet? You can keep up with the latest news by visiting <a href="http://webrtc.org">webrtc.org</a>.
              I am currently working with Mozilla Firefox team through Cisco by helping them implement WebRTC APIs in Firefox, more
              specifically in the signalling layer. It has been a challenging process thus far because for the past seven years, I have been
              working in the application layer. On the contrary, WebRTC' signaling layer is mostly C and C++. It is fun and I get to learn a
              lot. So far, I have been still in the learning phase and fixed a few defects. I am hoping to get involved with more core features
              soon. I have a sample WebRTC application (still a work in progress) hosted in github,
              <a href="https://github.com/charithtangirala/webrtc-app"> https://github.com/charithtangirala/webrtc-app</a>.
              Currently it supports end-to-end video and audio calling. Feel free to fork! If you are looking for a step-by-step tutorial,
              take a look at <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/"> HTML5 Rocks</a> site.

              You might be wondering how Cisco is involved in WebRTC. Let me explain, Cisco open-sourced its SIP stack, SDP Engine and
              Call-Control application logic used in Cisco's Soft Phone product. The open source project can be found on GitHub by name
              <a href="https://github.com/ethanhugg/ikran">ikran</a>. A few engineers from Cisco have been collaborating with Mozilla team
              to implement WebRTC in Firefox and that is how I got involved.

                I recently started reading a book by John Allspaw on Web Operations. Web Operations is all about site reliability, architecture
                and computing. A Web Operations engineer is an all-rounder who has broad understanding of several architectural components such as
                processor architectures, memory systems, storage systems, network switching and routing, HTTP, database, etc. I think it is simply
                awesome to be involved in architecting a solution which is thourougly monitored and easy to diagnose in the event of major downtime.
                If you are about to build such an infrastructure or have aspirations to be an architect or web/dev operations engineer, then this
                book is a very good read.
